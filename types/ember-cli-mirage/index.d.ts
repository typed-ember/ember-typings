     * the actual network layer.
     *
     * _**Tip:** Put all passthrough config at the bottom of your `config.js`
     * file, to give your route handlers precedence._
     *
     * You can also pass a list of paths, or call `passthrough` multiple times.
     *
     * If you want only certain verbs to pass through, pass an array as the last
     * argument with the specified verbs.
     *
     * If you want all requests on the current domain to pass through, simply
     * invoke the method with no arguments. Note again that the current namespace
     * (i.e. any `namespace` property defined above this call) will be applied.
     *
     * You can also allow other-origin hosts to passthrough. If you use a
     * fully-qualified domain name, the `namespace` property will be ignored.
     * Use two * wildcards to match all requests under a path.
     *
     * Be aware that currently, passthrough only works with jQuery >= 2.x. See [this issue] for details.
